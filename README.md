My custom iTerm2 patch and build. Consistently updated.

* ~~Added advanced option to set width of vertical cursor~~ You can now change the cursor width in *Preferences > Advanced > Vertical bar cursor width*

* ~~Reverted to slightly bolder font smoothing~~ Set *Preferences > Profiles > Text > Use thin strokes for anti-aliased text* to Never

Copy `Terminal.app` to `/Applications` or apply the patch yourself. (Open an issue if it fails patching so I can fix it)
